 * @notice This contract holds the core logic for manipulating ARC state. Ideally
        both state and logic could be in one or as libraries however the bytecode
        size is too large for this to occur. The core can be replaced via a new
        proxy implementation for upgrade purposes. Important to note that NO user
        funds are held in this contract. All funds are held inside the synthetic
        asset itself. This was done to show transparency around how much collateral
        is always backing a synth via Etherscan.
